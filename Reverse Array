1.Reverse array


Input :  arr[] = {4, 5, 1, 2}
Output : arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 4}

Here we can see that input array is completely reverse which means first element takes the last position and last element takes first position similarly for other elements too

Apporach:

Our Main thing is that the last element takes the first position and the first element takes the last position.

So swapping leftmost element and right most element and incrementing left one and decrementing and till it reach base case left is less than right.


while (start < end)
        {
            temp = arr[start]; 
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        } 
Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:O(1)
