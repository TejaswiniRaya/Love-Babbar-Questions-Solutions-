Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space


Two pointers Approach:
1.Take two pointers low and high
2.Low=0 and high=n-1
3.if low pointer is negative then increment low
4.else swap low and high pointer and decrement high


int low = 0;
        int high = ar.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            if (ar[low] <= 0)
                low++;
            else
                swap(ar, low, high--);
        }
